## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
Aggregating decisions and behaviour, probability (normal and long-tailed distributions)

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Probability distributions are used to help model our world, enabling us to obtain estimates of the probability that a certain event may occur – or estimate the variability of an occurrence. This is actually a super common method to describe and possible predict the probability of an event. 

### What insights have I gained?
A major insight I have gained is that the main challenge when we consider probabilities is defining the characteristics of the variables of whose behaviour we are trying to describe – this is necessary to identify what distribution should be applied to model a process. Another insight I gained this week was why cities live forever and companied typically die – and how this can be overcome or prolonged at least

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A weakness I have observed is that it is necessary to identify the right distribution which is what allows for the proper application of a model.
