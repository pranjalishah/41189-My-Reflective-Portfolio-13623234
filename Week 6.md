## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
Path dependence, random walk models, growth in terms of concavity and convexity

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
When we look at growth – we can consider it in the sense of concavity and convexity and this can tell us if growth is likely to continue or stagnate.

### What insights have I gained?
We can work hard but if we don’t invest in new skills – growth will stagnate. Continued growth requires continued innovation.
