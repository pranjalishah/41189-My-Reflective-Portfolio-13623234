## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
Path dependence, random walk models, growth in terms of concavity and convexity, broadcast, diffusion and contagion, Markov Processes

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
When we look at growth – we can consider it in the sense of concavity and convexity and this can tell us if growth is likely to continue or stagnate.

### What insights have I gained?
We can work hard but if we don’t invest in new skills – growth will stagnate. Continued growth requires continued innovation. The ted talk watched for the discussion was especially interesting. Considering the growth of cities in comparison to companies was something that I had not considered before. This video also helped me better understand cities as a complex system and each individual that constitutes the city as an individual entitiy of innovation that helps a city grow. It was also interesting to consider the death of a company explicitly - while we hear of the phrase "the company died out" I never properly understood the reasons as to why a company died. Innovation is necessary for growth and this begins to make sense when consdier how fickle humans are or our constant need for 'new' - which would of course go on to include ideas, objects and the necessary innovation.
Partially observable Markov models were also interesting to consdier and their ability to transform phenomena into states that have a - probability or predicitibility.
