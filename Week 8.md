## Week 8

### What have I learnt this week?
Complexity and emergent behaviour, colonel blotto game

### What insights have I gained?
Collective action problems tend to be easier to solve the smaller and more homogenous the group of individuals or actors involved and the better the information is. 
When considering the colonel blotto game theory, I began to understand the real world applications that go far beyond what I initially expected. Wider applicability of the coloner blotto game is often employed in other forms of competition including the US election, terrorism, trials, hiring and sports
When we consider it in hiring - this is the most relevant real-life scenario for me - it is interesting to consider how applicants compete over relevant skills and abilities. Here it is necessary to decide what level each skill is worth developing so you have the best chance of being hired. The person that gets hired doesn't necessarily have the best skills overally but they tick the most criteria that was asked for.
