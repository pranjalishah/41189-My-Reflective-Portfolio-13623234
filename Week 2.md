## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt that we live in a complex world with diverse people, companies and governments whose behaviours are what produce a final result – including novel and unexpected phenomena. I was also introduced to the idea of many-model thinking and how prevalent it is in our daily lives.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Before this week I was unaware of the concept of many-model thinking and how I already employ it in my daily life subconsciously. I also now know the importance of modelling in order to develop better insight of complex systems. When we consider our world, models are especially useful as they act as simplifications of the world.

### What insights have I gained?
Many model thinkers essentially make better decision makers as they subconsciously critically analyse individual models to form their own – many model – way functioning.
I myself have employed this in developing my personal method of management and learning that is effective. To do this, I critically analyse methods that I have been exposed to and influenced by.
Another insight I have gained is by employing models we enable ourselves to consider the world in a sense that allows us to think clearer, to use and understand data as well as to decide, strategize and design data for effective decision making.
