# 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt concepts that are fundamental to developing an understanding of complex systems and their relevance to my daily life including learning and defining what is meant by systems. I also learnt what is meant by what the term ‘complexity’ refers to in relation to human centred ‘complex’ systems. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that a system can be defined as a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole. I also now understand that a system is described by its spatial and temporal boundaries, influenced by its environment and can be understood by its structure and purpose in terms of function.

### What insights have I gained?
One important insight I have gained into our world is that almost all things can be broken down and better understood as a system. A system can be made up of many smaller systems – and this is what is understood as a complex system.
