## Week 9, 10, 11

### Group Project Progress
Group work begin earlier on in the semester whereby we began by conducting initial background research to understand the complexity and extent of oil spills was completed individually by the entire group. This was then used to understand the relevance of oil spills both on us as an individual entity and more broadly its impacts on society. Using our background research we were able to collaboratively develop our question: Modelling the social, economic, and environmental impacts of an oil spill to determine how the impacts can be lessened
After the presubmission we found that initially the question we had developed had a very large scope that would be difficult to consider in the given time frame. To overcome this, we decided to narrow the scope by considering the implications of oil spills in reference to past oil spill â€“ the deep water horizon oil spill in the gulf of Mexico that occurred in 2010. The implications of this oil spill are far reaching and are still being experienced at present day.
