## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
System dynamics, networks and agent based models, 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I was not previously aware of these models, but I now know of these models, how to apply them and their implications. I also now understand where these models can be best applied. To pick a model to model a specific system, it is important to understand what constitutes the model and its limitations.
