## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
System dynamics, networks and agent based models, 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I was not previously aware of these models, but I now know of these models, how to apply them and their implications. I also now understand where these models can be best applied. To pick a model to model a specific system, it is important to understand what constitutes the model and its limitations.
Rational vs behavioural vs rule-based model:

Rational behaviour provides us with a really good benchmark but when we stop to consider behavioural biases as well -  we can develop a better understanding of the differences in a model. In real life situations we are always employing rational/behavioural models when decision-making - and quite often to predict how decisions we make might affect another person (or what their reaction to our decision might be). By considering rational behaviour we are able to predict a benchmark  of their potential reaction but when we account for behavioural biases - this is when we would increase the accuracy of our prediction of their potential reaction. By tailoring our model of their reaction to their individual biases we can make informed decisions. 

Decision  Trees: 

Decision trees are super useful when our model is required to consider a lot of potential options. By using decision trees we essentially map out or 'model' all the outcomes that we believe might come about from a specific scenario. Decisions trees also prove to be useful in inferring how someone views the world while accounting for their biases. By gaining a 'whole view' - as decision makers we are enabled to make better decisions.
Signalling models:

Signalling models are effective models in considering behaviour. They consider and identify conditions under which people subconsciously send out costly signals to reveal information or personal preferences. Signalling to reveal status is inherent to human nature and once we are aware of it - easily recognisable. For signalling models to be effective - signalling requires for the costliness to carry meaning. We can employ signalling models in our daily lives to better display or understand true motives. 

Model of people's values and power:

Working in group settings is a scenario we are all too familiar with. Collaboration is something that we cannot avoid in real life scenarios. When a group produces output - it is difficult to determine individual contributions. 

LOTB is equals the value a group member adds if they are the last to join the group. LOTB values capture values at the margin while Shapley refers to the marginal contribution of a group member that's determined in a sequence. Using such models is super useful in real life scenarios to model and understand somethings contribution to the final picture.
