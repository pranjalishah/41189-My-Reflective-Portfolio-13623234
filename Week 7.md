## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?
Complexity and emergent behaviour

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Culture can be modelled as a combination of Lyapunov and Markov models, the Lyapunov model explains that the maximisation/minimisation in the absence of error to reach a specific state, and small errors that turn this process into a markov process as all possible states are now obtainable by stating from any other state. 

### What insights have I gained?
Culture is multiple and consistent coordination while small amounts of innovation/error can lead to large amounts of heterogeneity.
