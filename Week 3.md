## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt 3 core models and the underlying assumptions that are required to be considered when developing these models. I have also learnt about possible applications for these models and the implications that would follow. Some of these models required for specific maths to be applied when developing them. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that to better understand a complex system sometimes multiple models are required to be employed (fertility) – with each model defining a separate system pre-existing in the larger model.

### What insights have I gained?
Rational behaviour provides us with a really good benchmark but when we stop to consider behavioural biases as well -  we can develop a better understanding of the differences in a model. In real life situations we are always employing rational/behavioural models when decision-making - and quite often to predict how decisions we make might affect another person (or what their reaction to our decision might be). While this might not be considered a new insight as I already did this subconsciously – I was unaware of how often we use rational behaviour to set a benchmark when decision-making, especially when considering social behaviour or another individuals reaction.
